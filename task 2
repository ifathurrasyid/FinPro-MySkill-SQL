QUESTION:
In 2022, which category produces the highest transaction value? Use is_valid = 1 to filter the transactions.



-- With normal query

select
	sd.category as category,
	sum(od.after_discount) as total
from
	sku_detail sd 
join
	order_detail od 
on
	od.sku_id = sd.id
where
	od.is_valid = 1
and 
extract (year from od.order_date) = 2022
group by
	category
order by
	total desc
limit 
	1
;

-- With CTE

with lookup as
	(select
		sd.category as category,
		sum(od.after_discount) as total
	from
		sku_detail sd 
	join
		order_detail od 
	on
		od.sku_id = sd.id
	where
		od.is_valid = 1
	and 
	extract
		(year from od.order_date) = 2022
	group by
		category
	order by
		total desc
	)
select 
	*
from 
	lookup
limit

;
